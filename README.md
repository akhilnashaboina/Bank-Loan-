### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a bank's lending operations and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower profiles. Using SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization, this report helps stakeholders track lending performance, identify trends, and make informed, data-driven decisions.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build an end-to-end reporting solution for bank loan data.
- Monitor Total Loan Applications, Funded Amounts, Amounts Received, and Borrower Risk Metrics.
- Evaluate Good Loans vs. Bad Loans to assess portfolio quality.
- Identify patterns based on Loan Terms, Purposes, Employment Length, and Regional Distribution.
- Provide an interactive dashboard for real-time insights and filtering capabilities.

### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
1. Data Source: Simulated bank loan dataset containing details such as:

- Loan ID, Purpose, Home Ownership, Grade, Issue Date
- Loan Amount, Installment, Interest Rate, Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- Loan Status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current), Total Payment

2. Data Analysis (SQL):

- Data cleaning and KPI calculations.
- Monthly trends, MTD/PMTD comparisons.
- Good vs. Bad loan classification.
- Loan performance segmented by state, loan term, purpose, and borrower characteristics.

3. Dashboard Creation (Tableau):

- Summary Dashboard: Key KPIs, Good vs. Bad Loan distribution, Loan Status grid.
- Overview Dashboard: Trends by month, regional distribution, borrower profiles.
- Details Dashboard: Granular transaction-level view for further exploration.

### ðŸ›  Tools Used
SQL â€“ Data extraction, transformation, KPI calculations

Tableau â€“ Interactive dashboards and visual analytics

Excel/CSV â€“ Initial dataset storage and preparation

### ðŸ“Š Key Insights & Outcomes
- 38.6K total loan applications analyzed with over $435M funded.
- Good loans (Fully Paid + Current) accounted for 86.2% of the portfolio, while Bad loans (Charged Off) stood at 13.8%.
- Highest loan purposes: Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing.
- Regional trends: States like California and Texas had the highest loan volumes.
- Borrowers with 10+ years of employment had the most approved applications.
- Month-over-month growth of 6.9% in applications and 13% in funded amount indicated a positive lending trend.

### ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Automate data updates via ETL pipelines.
- Implement predictive modeling for loan default risk.
- Deploy dashboard to Tableau Server or Power BI Service for wider accessibility.
